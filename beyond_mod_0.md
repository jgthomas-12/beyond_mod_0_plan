## To Mod 1 and Beyond
---



1. I plan on studying daily to get as much practice and prework in before mod 1 begins but I'm going to follow more of a dedicated schedule as far as WHAT information to be going over. It's been suggested that I start with some of the "Exercises" located on the Mod 1 page so I think I will start with those. I will continue to study concepts using the "Next items of study" list below and checking back with codewars to get more experience with trying to solve problems from scratch.

    >Note: I feel like my own self study needs to be regulated and should       reflect some of the mod 1 lessons as reference points. I continue to find myself going down rabbit holes. For this last study session I've found myself trying to understand enumerables, which has been going well but this lead into regexp and trying to understand regular expressions. It all seems like too much of a rabbit hole and I'm trying to figure out what I need to be prepared for this final exam/evaluation. 
    > - I plan to try and stay ahead of the lessons in Mod 1 by doing research prior to class. 

2. I'll be working throughout the weeks prior to the beginning of the course so most of my study will be on evenings or weekends. I'm going to have to be good about scheduling my time out to make sure I use the time wisely to get the most out of this. I'll be using my calendar to make sure I have a good handle on what to study. Recreational time I expect to plan for is going to include climbing, band practice and the shows we have lined up in the upcoming months. 

3. Meal prepping has been going well and I'd like to be better about making different meals and having more options. I've been drawing more recently and I'm finding it calming as a precursor to doing long days of work, even if it's just warm up sketches for 10-20 minutes. I'm enjoying the setup but thinking about getting myself an adjustable desk. I'm going to have to save up a bit for something like this but I do think it'll be a good option for a lot of aspects.
